<summary>üìù Final Notes on App Functionality</summary>

- At the bottom of the app, there are 5 icons. Select the 3rd icon to display the TV channel programming guide.
- On the left side, different channels are shown using icons because the original images from the API are no longer available.
- At the top, there is a date selector; however, it currently has no functionality as the API always returns data for the current day.
- On the right side, a list of movies or shows is displayed in their respective time slots.
- There is a "Now" button at the bottom left that allows you to jump directly to the movies currently being broadcast.
- A vertical line indicates the current time on the schedule.
- You can refresh the data by pulling down completely when at the top of the list.

- The Norigin Media company icon was updated because the previous one was no longer available.
- The primary color was changed to better match the logo.

- There are three ways to view movie details:
  1. Selecting a movie that has already aired (before the current purple line) shows past details including season information.
  2. Selecting a movie currently airing displays live details.
  3. Selecting a movie airing in the future shows upcoming movie information.
